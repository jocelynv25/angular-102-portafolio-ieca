Are you into me, like I'm into you?
Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you?
You're so close, and yet so far
I wonder how you look when you're in the dark

You're just one click away
Click away, click away
From something real or fake
Real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away
Click away, click away
From something real or fake
Real or fake, real or fake

Played you Doom, man, you play Drake
You left crumbs all on my face
Taste like riri, taste like bey
Bought you fenty, took his place
Rolled your weed and kissed your face
Man, wanna smoke you out like all day
Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
You be all down for the boy, no mass

Hot jump, skiprope, twenty-three years old
Made a hundred grand and
Went broke, I'm an asshole
Clairo, will you be my real and my fake though
Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
Frame my life and take my soul
Make me crazy, make me old
Send me roses, text my phone
Fake like rappers, fake like jokes I know

You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
